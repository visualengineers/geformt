This paper presents GeForMTjs, a library which features an abstract way of representing multi-touch gestures. A domain specific language for multi-touch gestures, Gesture Formalization for Multi-touch (GeForMT), is adapted to the needs of web development. Web standards are addressed and mouse input is incorporated as well. A short overview of related work shows that a formal abstraction of multi-touch gestures is missing in the web context. A brief example illustrates the seven processing steps of the library.
